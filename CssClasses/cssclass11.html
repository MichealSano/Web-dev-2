        <!-- Css positions
         1 static-default-- the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the page .
         so if we set left/right/top.buttom there would be no effect on the element.
         2 relative--the element orginal position is according to the normal flow of thre the page
         just like satic values, but now if we set left/right/top.buttom there would be no effect on the element.
         3 absolute-- the element is completely removed from the document flow ,it is positioned WRT
         its containing block it may overlap other element or br overlaped by them
         4 fixed-- just like absolute except the containing block is always the view point.
         5-- sticky-- the element stick to the top of it nearest positioned ancestors that has the scrolling mechanism-->
